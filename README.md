# LIVE_STOCK_PRICE_PREDICTION
This project uses historical stock market data to predict future stock prices using machine learning models like Linear Regression, LSTM, and ARIMA. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation. Visualizations and predictions are generated to support investment analysis.

A real-time stock price prediction system using financial indicators and machine learning models. This project integrates data from live stock APIs, processes the data with technical indicators, and uses predictive models to forecast short-term stock price movements.

🚀 **Project Overview**

This repository contains code and resources for building a system that:

Fetches live stock market data

Applies financial feature engineering (like RSI, MACD, moving averages)

Trains and tests machine learning models (like LSTM, XGBoost, or Random Forest)

Predicts stock prices in real-time or near real-time

Visualizes prediction results interactively

📚 **Features**

🔄 Live Data Integration via APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or yfinance)

📊 Financial Indicators used as model inputs

🤖 Machine Learning Models for forecasting (supports LSTM, XGBoost, etc.)

📉 Visualization Tools using Matplotlib, Plotly, or Streamlit

🛠️ Modular Codebase with clean and reusable components

**Feedback**
